These batteries are usually rechargeable (secondary) batteries, and are typically lithium- ion batteries. These batteries are specifically designed for a high ampere-hour (or kilowatt-hour) capacity. Electric-vehicle batteries differ from starting, lighting, and ignition (SLI) batteries as they are designed to give power over sustained periods of time and are deep-cycle batteries. 3. Drive Motor/electric Motor is a motor which is fitted on the axles which converts electric energy into mechanical energy. 4. HEV (Hybrid electric vehicle) system - The HEV system contains of Electric motor, DC/DC step down converter, electric generator & power electronics controller 5. In case of an accident, payment under this add-on would be made only when there is evidence of under carriage damage to Battery and resulting into damage to covered parts as mentioned above. 6. In case of short circuit while mounting, dismounting or vehicle in charging port resulting into damage/failure to covered parts as mentioned above. 7. Maximum',\n",
